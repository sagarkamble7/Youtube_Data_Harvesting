YouTube_Data_Harvesting
Conducting ethical YouTube data harvesting involves leveraging key libraries like googleapiclient, streamlit, mysql-connector-python, pymongo, and pandas. The aim is to gather data ethically, store it securely, and ensure compliance with privacy regulations and platform guidelines.

Navigating the realm of YouTube data extraction demands a strong ethical foundation, emphasizing adherence to YouTube's terms, obtaining proper authorization, and complying with data protection regulations. It's crucial to handle the gleaned information responsiblyâ€”ensuring privacy, confidentiality, and preventing misuse or distortion. Consideration for the broader impact on YouTube's platform and community is paramount, striving for fairness and sustainability throughout the scraping process to maintain integrity while extracting profound insights from the data.

The essential libraries for this endeavor are:

googleapiclient.discovery
streamlit
mysql-connector-python
pymongo
pandas
The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing application includes the following components:

Data Retrieval: Utilizing the YouTube API to gather comprehensive channel and video data.
Data Storage: Establishing a secure repository using MongoDB Compass, serving as a versatile data lake.
Migration to SQL: Streamlining data by migrating from the data lake to a MySQL database for efficient analysis.
Search Functionality: Enabling diverse search options for data retrieval and exploration within the SQL database, enhancing analytical capabilities.

Approach:
1. Set up a Streamlit app: Streamlit is a great choice for building data
visualization and analysis tools quickly and easily. You can use Streamlit to
create a simple UI where users can enter a YouTube channel ID, view the
channel details, and select channels to migrate to the data warehouse.
2. Connect to the YouTube API: You'll need to use the YouTube API to retrieve
channel and video data. You can use the Google API client library for Python to
make requests to the API.
3. Store data in a MongoDB data lake: Once you retrieve the data from the
YouTube API, you can store it in a MongoDB data lake. MongoDB is a great
choice for a data lake because it can handle unstructured and semi-structured
data easily.
4. Migrate data to a SQL data warehouse: After you've collected data for
multiple channels, you can migrate it to a SQL data warehouse. You can use a
SQL database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL for this.
5. Query the SQL data warehouse: You can use SQL queries to join the tables
in the SQL data warehouse and retrieve data for specific channels based on
user input. You can use a Python SQL library such as SQLAlchemy to interact
with the SQL database.
6. Display data in the Streamlit app: Finally, you can display the retrieved data
in the Streamlit app. You can use Streamlit's data visualization features to
create charts and graphs to help users analyze the data.
